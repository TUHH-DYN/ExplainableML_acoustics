We share the code along our latest paper 'Explainable machine learning determines effects on the sound absorption coefficient measured in the impedance tube' submitted to **The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America (Special Issue on Machine Learning)** in 2020. 

Please find the special issue here: https://asa.scitation.org/jas/info/specialissues/cfp_110120

We will link the paper as soon as it is published.
